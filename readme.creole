= Sublime Alignment

A Sublime Text 2 (http://www.sublimetext.com/2) plugin that provides a simple key-binding for aligning multi-line selections and multiple selections.

== Installation

Clone or copy this repository to your Packages directory (the folder that is opened when clicking the "Preferences > Browse Packages..." menu entry).

== Usage

Press ctrl+shift+a (Windows, Linux) or cmd+shift+a (OS X). The following examples use a {{{|}}} to indicate a cursor. {{{<<<}}} indicates the beginning of a selection and {{{>>>}}} indicates the end of a selection.

If multiple lines are selected within a single selection and the left edges are not indented to the same level, all lines will be shifted to have a consistent indent level. The indentation will follow the current indentation preferences, either spaces or tabs.

Before:

{{{
<<<
var foo = 1;
  var bazz = foo;
	var qu = foo + bazz;
>>>
}}}

After:

{{{
<<<
	var foo = 1;
	var bazz = foo;
	var qu = foo + bar;
>>>
}}}

If multiple lines are selected with a single selection and all selected lines have the same indent level, the first equal sign on each line will all be aligned to the same column, using spaces.

Before:

{{{
<<<
	var foo = 1;
	var bazz = foo;
	var qu = foo + bar;
>>>
}}}

After:

{{{
<<<
	var foo  = 1;
	var bazz = foo;
	var qu   = foo + bar;
>>>
}}}

If multiple selections exist, spaces will be inserted to cause all selections to be aligned to the same column.

Before:

{{{
array(
	'foo'| => 1,
	'bazz'| => 2,
	'qu'| => 3
)
}}}

After:

{{{
array(
	'foo' | => 1,
	'bazz'| => 2,
	'qu'  | => 3
)
}}}
